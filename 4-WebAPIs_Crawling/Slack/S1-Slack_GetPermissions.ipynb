    "The code below illustrates how we connect to the Slack API to request an authorization token for our app. Remember that we have to register our app with Slack first, and get the `client_id`.\n",

    "#### Creating a Slack App\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create your app. You will need the \"Client ID\" and the \"Client Secrete\" that is created for you.\n",
    "* Select the \"OAuth & Permissions\" tab from the left-hand side and add a \"Redirect URL\" for your app. The redirect URL ensures (for security) that the app can only talk to your own web server. Add `http://<yourIP>:5000/slack` as your redirect URL.\n",
    "* Select the \"Bot Users\" tab from the left-hand side and add a bot username for your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Get the Web Server up and running\n",
    "\n",
    "See the Python Script `WebServer_Receive_Slack_Authentication.py` that is in this folder. That server should be running (and serve at the `http://<yourIP>:5000/slack` URL, so that it can receive the authentication code for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launch the user authentication process\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will create a pop-up window, and will send the user to the Slack authentication page. Slack will verify the identity of the user, and ask the user whether the app is trusted. Once the user logins and grants the permissions, then the Slack server will call the `http://<yourIP>:5000/slack` URL and send the authentication code. \n",
    "\n",
    "At that point, out web server (running as a Python Script), will call back Slack saying \"hey, I got the code, here is the verification that I am indeed the correct app, here is my `client_secret`. (See the `WebServer_Receive_Slack_Authentication.py` code.)"

    "LinkedIn is the worlds largest business social networking hub. Launched in 2003, LinkedIn has millions of users and is implemented in over 200 countries. One purpose of the site is to allow registered users to maintain a list of contact details of people with whom they have some level of relationship, called Connections. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn actually provides 2 APIs: \n",

    "- The **JavaScript API** is a rich client library enabling you to build dynamic applications in the web browser. Use OAuth 2 to easily authorize users via the \"Sign In with LinkedIn\" button, access LinkedIn data with native objects, and interact with Plugins.\n",
    "- The **REST API** provides a simple, consistent representation of people, companies, jobs, and the interactions and relationships between them. Our query language lets you read data in XML and JSON at the granularity and aggregation that you choose. Use OAuth 1.0a to authorize users and begin making REST API calls using any programming language."

    "## Getting of access token\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your application is properly configured, it's time to request an authorization code. The authorization code is used in the next step of the OAuth 2.0 flow to exchange for an actual access token. This is an important step because it provides assurance directly from LinkedIn to the user that permission is being granted to the correct application, with the agreed-upon access to the member's LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "To request an authorization code, you must direct the user's browser to LinkedIn's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint (how it can be done with the help of Python is shown below):\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://www.linkedin.com/uas/oauth2/authorization\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once the request is made, one of the following two situations will occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the user has not previously accepted the application's permission request, or the grant has expired or been manually revoked by the user, the browser will be redirected to LinkedIn's authorization screen (as seen in the picture below).  When the user completes the authorization process, the browser is redirected to the URL provided in the redirect_uri query parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is a valid existing permission grant from the user, the authorization screen is by-passed and the user is immediately redirected to the URL provided in the redirect_uri query parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/app_4.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing valid LinkedIn credentials and clicking on the \"Allow Access\" button, the user is approving your application's request to access their member data and interact with LinkedIn on their behalf.  This approval instructs LinkedIn to redirect the user back to the callback URL that you defined in your `redirect_uri` parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attached to the redirect_uri will be two important URL arguments that you need to read from the request:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `code` — The OAuth 2.0 authorization code (value that you will exchange with LinkedIn for an actual OAuth 2.0 access token in the next step of the authentcation process).\n",
    "* `state` — A value used to test for possible CSRF attacks (before you accept the authorization code, your application should ensure that the value returned in the state parameter matches the state value from your original authorization code request).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step towards obtaining an Access Token is for your application to ask for one using the Authorization Code it just acquired. This is done by making the following \"x-www-form-urlencoded\" HTTP POST request:\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://www.linkedin.com/uas/oauth2/accessToken\n",
    "    \n",
    "A successful Access Token request will return a JSON object containing the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `access_token` — The access token for the user. This value must be kept secure, as per your agreement to the API Terms of Use.\n",
    "* `expires_in` — The number of seconds remaining, from the time it was requested, before the token will expire.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Currently, all access tokens are issued with a 60 day lifespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've obtained an Access Token, you can start making authenticated API requests on behalf of the user. This is accomplished by including an \"Authorization\" header in your HTTP call to LinkedIn's API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make described above using Python library `requests` and `requests_oauthlib`. To install them (if they are absent) you can use pip:\n",

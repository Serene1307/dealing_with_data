* Rename class to "Introduction to Programming for Data Science". 

* if statements (and nested blocks of code) together with boolean variables

* Add while loops before discussing for loops. Allows easier discussion of break/continue compared to for. (Perhaps even before complex data structures, as it is connected with if-else?)

* More exercises in loops
